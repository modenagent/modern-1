                A form of insurance in which the

                insured from specified losses,

            <p class="small_text">
                Once you find the right home,
                you’ll make an offer on the
                property with the help of an
                agent or attorney. If the seller
                counters your original offer, it’s
                usually because they want more
                money or a faster timeline for
                closing the deal, at which point
                you’ll have to negotiate. When
                submitting an offer, it’s a good
                idea to add a personal touch
                by including a cover letter that
                explains why you want to buy
                the home.

                same interest rate throughout
                the life of the loan. An adjustable
                rate mortgage has a variable
                interest rate that changes after a
                predetermined amount of years.
