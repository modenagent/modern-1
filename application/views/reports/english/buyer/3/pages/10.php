                This is the portion of your payment that goes to pay
                down the balance that you borrowed. If you opt for
                a fi xed-rate loan, your monthly payment will not
                change over the loan term, but the makeup of your
                payment will change. In the early years of your loan,
                you mostly pay interest, but gradually you will begin
                to pay more of the principal. The interest you pay is
                the cost of borrowing money.

                You will pay one year of homeowner’s insurance
                premiums at your home settlement as part of your
                closing costs, and then your lender will collect onetwelfth of your annual insurance premium in this
                account with each mortgage payment. While most
                lenders require you to pay your homeowner’s
                insurance this way.
