            <p class="small_text">
                A home warranty is a service contract that covers the
                repair or replacement of important home system
                components and appliances that break down over
                time. A home warranty can help save you money.
            </p>
            <h4 class="table_title">What Does It Cover</h4>
            <p class="small_text">
                Items available for home warranty coverage may
                include: central air conditioning systems, central
                heating systems, kitchen appliances, clothes washer
                and dryer, plumbing system, electrical system and
                roof leaks. Many of these items are covered based
                on the home warranty plan that you choose.

            <h4 class="table_title">Home Warranty Vs. Home Insurance</h4>
            <p class="small_text">
                Home Insurance covers what might happen, but
                if your A/C, refrigerator, or heating system went
                out, who would you call? Unlike most homeowners
                insurance, a Home Warranty covers what will
                happen like the inevitable breakdowns of major
                home system components and appliances that wear
                out over time.
