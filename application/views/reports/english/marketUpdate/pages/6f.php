         When your property first hits the market the entire audience which consists of realtors, prospective buyers, and sellers all place eyes on your listing. They all make rapid judgements as to it’s price, current condition, and location. How they first perceive it will determine the viewing activity over the next few weeks. If we receive no viewings initially, we are facing the possibility that that market as a whole is rejecting the value proposition of your listing. Our solution? Reduce the price.

         Reducing the price of your home is never an easy call but often time is a necessary one that might need to be made in order to get your home sold. Many homeowners feel that they are giving up hard won equity which they have built up. In reality a slight reduction can help avoid problems down the line. The question is, When is the best time? From the time the property is first placed on the market the rule of thumb is 30-45 days.
