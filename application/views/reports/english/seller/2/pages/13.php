        Overpricing can have a significant negative impact on how long your home is on the market
        and its final sale price. To get the best possible outcome, an intelligent pricing strategy is used
        to attract more buyers in a shorter amount of time, resulting in a better sale price for you.

                Your home receives the most
                attention when it’s first listed,
                and a sale is more likely when
                it’s new on the market. In
                order to take advantage of this
                window of opportunity, it’s
                imperative to set a competitive
                and attractive price.

                If a home is priced too high, it
                will remain on the market for
                a longer period of time, which
                could necessitate a price
                reduction and the probability
                of having to settle for a sale
                price that is much lower than
                the list price and its
