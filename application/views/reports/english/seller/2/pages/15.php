                your property. Depending on the geographic area of your home. The
                number of days that your home is on the market can vary. Currently

                When someone is looking to pack up and move they
                typically would do so in good weather. So if your
                home is listed during the winter or the rainy season
                this may add to days on market.

                When interest rates are low the typical median
                home price tends to rise. During this time motivated
                buyers take less time to commit to a home which
                leads to less time on market and quicker sales.
