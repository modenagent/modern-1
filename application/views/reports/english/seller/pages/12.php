            <h4 class="mt-0 sub_title">Selling Faster by Setting the Right Price</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                At any given time, there are plenty of buyers in the market looking for newly listed properties. As your agent,
                I want to make sure to help you attract as many buyers as possible. One thing that can hinder this is setting
                the price too high. The key to getting your home sold as quickly as possible is to price it correctly from day 1.
                Many sellers have the tendency to want to list their home at a higher sales price than advised because they
                hope to increase their profi t or they assume that buyers always make low off ers so it’s good to start high

                    <h4>1. On Market Longer</h4>
                    <p>
                        Properties that are over priced tend to stay on the
                        market significantly longer than those that are
                        priced to sell.
                    </p>
                    <h4>2. Price Reduction</h4>
                    <p>
                        Overpriced properties will most certainly need to
                        do at least 1 price reduction to regenerate interest
                        in your property.

                    <h4>3. Lost Time</h4>
                    <p>
                        Time lost in waiting for an off er can be time spent
                        accepting off ers, conducting inspections & opening escrow.

                    <h4>4. Stigma Developed</h4>
                    <p>
                        As buyers see the property advertised over and
                        over again, they will start wondering if there’s
                        something wrong with it.
