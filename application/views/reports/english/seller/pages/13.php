                        Days on market has a direct correlation with a buyers interest level in your
                        property. Depending on the geographic area of your home. The number
                        of days that your home is on the market can vary. Currently the market
                        is in an upswing and the shortage of inventory is leading to homes fl ying

                        Can be a geographic location or type of housing.
                        So if a certain eclectic neighborhood is deemed
                        desirable, that creates demand which will lead to
                        homes being sold quickly.

                        When someone is looking to pack up and move they
                        typically would do so in good weather. So if your
                        home is listed during the winter or the rainy season
                        this may add to days on market.

                    <h4>Economy</h4>
                    <p>
                        When interest rates are low the typical median
                        home price tends to rise. During this time motivated
                        buyers take less time to commit to a home which
                        leads to less time on market and quicker sales.
