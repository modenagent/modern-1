           Most buyers now begin their search online either at home, on their break at work, but more often than not, on their mobile device. Since more than 80% of buyers begin their home search online they are simultaneously taking the opportunity to educate themselves on the buying process. So todays buyer is now more informed than ever but will still rely on a realtor to guide them through the transaction. The typical home buyer takes about 3 months to purchase their home, which means they have been looking for 2 months before your decided to sell your home.
