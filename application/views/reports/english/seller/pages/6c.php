							<h2>MLS & MORE   </h2>

								The MLS, which is an acronym for the multiple listing service is the preferred network utilized by realtors to make real estate listings available online. This is the very first place where we will list your home because realtors who are currently working with pre-approved buyers will be notified first. All the enhanced photos, property details, and sales price will be placed within the listing.
