								In a perfect world, every home buyer and every home seller would get exactly the deal they want for their real estate transaction. In reality, the best deals are the ones in which each side feels they got most of what they wanted and didn't have to give up too much.

								The negotiating portion of a real estate transaction can be exciting, frustrating, and tedious. As a seller you want to get what you feel your
                                home is worth and I want to help make that happen. My qualifications will help keep the negotiating terms in your favor.

                                The goal is to make sure you avoid pitfalls that many sellers are faced when selling their home. The most common are:

                             	<h4 class="making" style="color: <?php echo $theme ?>;">-Not making sure buyers are qualified</h4>
                             	<h4 class="making" style="color: <?php echo $theme ?>;">- Not understanding contract and forms</h4>
                             	<h4 class="making" style="color: <?php echo $theme ?>;">- Failing to disclose all property facts</h4>
                             	<h4 class="making" style="color: <?php echo $theme ?>;" >- Setting up contingencies </h4>
                                <h4 class="making" style="color: <?php echo $theme ?>;">- Handling the buyers deposit</h4>  <br><br>

                                <p> 
                                 
                                 The thing to remember about negotiating is that it's not where you start but rather where you finish. My goal is to make sure that you finish first every time.
