							<h2>When This Came Into Effect</h2>
							<p>The Supplemental Real Property Tax Law was
								signed by the Governor in July of 1983 and is
								part of an ambitious drive to aid California's
								schools. This property tax revision is expected
								to produce over $300 million per year in
								revenue for schools.
							</p>

							<h2>How Supplemental Taxes Affect You</h2>
							<p>
								If you don't plan on buying new property or
								undertaking any new construction, this new
								tax will not affect you at all. But, if you do
								wish to do either of the two, you will be
								required to pay a supplemental property tax
								which can become a lien against your
								property if not paid by the required due date.

							</p>

							<h2>Billing: When And How</h2>
							<p>
								“When” is not easy to predict. You could be
								billed in as few as three weeks, or it could
								take over six months. “When” also depends
								on the individual county and the workload of
								the County Assessor, the County
								Controller/Auditor and the County Tax
								Collector. The assessor will appraise your
								property and advise you of the new
								supplemental assessment amount. The
								County will then calculate the amount of the
								supplemental tax and the tax collector will
								mail you a supplemental tax bill.

							</p>	
						</div>

						<div class="text-block-condensed">
							<h2>What Comes On The Bill</h2>
							<p>
								The supplemental tax bill will identify, among
								other things, the following information: the
								amount of the supplemental tax and the date
								on which the taxes will become delinquent.
