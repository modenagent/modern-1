                                                            This is the portion of your payment that goes
                                                            to pay down the balance that you borrowed.
                                                            If you opt for a fixed-rate loan, your monthly
                                                            payment will not change over the loan term,
                                                            but the makeup of your payment will change.
                                                            In the early years of your loan, you mostly pay
                                                            interest, but gradually you will begin to pay
                                                            more of the principal. The interest you pay is the cost of borrowing
                                                            money.

                                                            premiums at your home settlement as

                                                            will collect one-twelfth of your annual insurance
                                                            premium in this account with each mortgage
                                                            payment. While most lenders require you
                                                            to pay your homeowner&rsquo;s insurance this way.
