						We wanted to congratulate you on taking the first steps towards homeownership. For many this is a monumental period in their lives. Whether this is your first home purchase or your second you can rest assured that you are in excellent hands. Our goal is to keep you in the loop of every detail regarding your transaction. For this very reason we have prepared this buyerâ€™s proposal report that is a great point of reference to better understand the home buying process.
