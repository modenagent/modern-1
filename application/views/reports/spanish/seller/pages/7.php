							<h2>Impound Account Vs. Direct</h2>
							<p>
								This is the portion of your payment that goes to pay down the balance that you borrowed. If you opt for a fixed-rate loan, your monthly payment will not change over the loan term, but the makeup of your payment will change. In the early years of your loan, you mostly pay interest, but gradually you will begin to pay more of the principal.

							<h2>Impound Account Vs. Direct</h2>
							<p>
								You will pay one year of homeowner's insurance premiums at your home settlement as part of your closing costs, and then your lender will collect one-twelfth of your annual insurance premium in this account with each mortgage payment. While most lenders require you to pay your homeowner's insurance this way.

							<h2>Property Tax Due Dates</h2>
							<p>
								Your lender usually requires an escrow account and will collect one-twelfth of your annual property tax bill in this account with each mortgage payment.
							</p>
							<p>
								**Penalties for delinquency are 10% on date of
								delinquency, plus $10.00 for delinquent 2nd
								installment. Thereafter, 1.5% per month of
								original tax amount until paid.
