                    Buying your first home can be exciting. Most of us are already picking
                    out the new couch we want for the living room before weâ€™ve even
                    closed escrow. Buyers are guided through the process of what to do
                    when buying a home, but many people leave out the equally
                    important list of what NOT to do.<br><br>
                    Keeping it simple, here is my list
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Don't</span> buy things for your new home until after you close
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Don't</span> consolidate debt without speaking to your lender first
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Don't</span> change bank accounts
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Don't</span> apply or co-sign for any new credit
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Don't</span> quit or change jobs
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Don't</span> move assets around from account to account
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Don't</span> run a credit report on yourself
                </p>
