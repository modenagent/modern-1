                <p>
                    If a buyer or seller want to change an
                    existing contract, they might add an
                    addendum outlining the specific part of
                    the contract they’d like to adjust and the
                    parameters of that change. The rest of
                    the contract stays the same, regardless
                    of the addendum.

                <p class="mb-0"><b>APPRAISAL</b></p>
                <p>
                    An appraisal on your home is an
                    unbiased estimate of how much a home
                    is worth. When buying a home, the
                    lender requires an appraisal by a third
                    party (the appraiser) to make sure the
                    loan amount requested is accurate. If the
                    home’s appraised value is below what
                    the buyer has offered, the lender may
                    request the buyer pay the difference in
                    cost
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0"><b>ASSESSED VALUE</b></p>
                <p>
                    Anassessment is used to determine how much in taxes the owner of a property will pay.Anassess or calculates the assessment of a home’s value by looking at comparable homes in your area and reviewing an inspection of the home in question.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0"><b>ASSIGNMENT</b></p>
                <p>
                    Anassignment is when the seller of a property signs over rights and obligations to that property to the buyer before the official closing.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0"><b>CLEAR TITLE</b></p>
                <p>
                    Also known as a “just title,” “good title,” or a “free and clear title” — a clear title doesn’t have any kind of lien or levy from creditors. It means there’s no question of legal ownership of the property such as building code violations or bads urveys.

                <p class="mb-0"><b>CLOSING</b></p>
                <p>
                    Closing is the final stage of the real estate transaction. The date is agreed upon when both the buyer and seller gounder contracton the home. On the closing date, the property is legally transferred froms eller to buyer.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0"><b>CLOSING COSTS</b></p>
                <p>
                    Closing costs are usually comprised of
                    between 2-5% of the total purchase price
                    of the home. According to a recent
                    survey by Zillow, the average homebuyer
                    pays approximately $3,700 in closing
                    costs. These fees are paid on or by the
                    closing date.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0"><b>CO-BORROWER</b></p>
                <p>
                    If a buyer is having trouble getting
                    approved for a loan, they can elicit the
                    help of a co-borrower. This person is
                    usually a family member or friend who’s
                    added to the mortgage and guarantees
                    the loan. They’re listed on the title, have
                    ownership interest, sign loan documents,
                    and are obligated to pay monthly
                    mortgage payments if the buyer is
                    unable to.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0"><b>COMPARABLE SALES</b></p>
                <p>
                    Comparable sales are used by an
                    appraiser to establish how much a home
                    is worth based on what other similar
                    homes in the area have sold for recently.
                    Only homes that have legally closed
                    count as a comp — and most lenders and
                    insurance providers require appraisers to
                    use at least three closed sales.
