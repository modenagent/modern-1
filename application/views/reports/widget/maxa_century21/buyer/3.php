                    Since 2005, I have become one of the most trusted and
                    top-selling real estate agents in all of San Diego County. By
                    recognizing the importance of trust with my clients, I have
                    continued to exceed their expectations year by year. Whether
                    it’s residential or commercial, I am your local expert for all
                    your real estate needs.<br><br>
                    Since 2010, I have ranked amongst the Top 1% in all of
                    CENTURY 21 with an annual average of $70 million in sales
                    volume. I specialize in the unique & exclusive communities of
                    La Jolla, Del Mar, Encinitas, Solana Beach & Rancho Santa Fe.
                    If you’re looking more for the big city look & feel, I can show
                    you our luxury high rises downtown.<br><br>
                    San Diego is my home; I grew up here and graduated
                    from San Diego State University with a bachelor’s in
                    communication. When it comes to real estate, I am always
                    continuing my education by investing my time and money to
                    learn the latest sales, marketing, and negotiation techniques.<br><br>
                    Outside of real estate, I enjoy traveling, cooking, and spending
                    time with my family and friends.
