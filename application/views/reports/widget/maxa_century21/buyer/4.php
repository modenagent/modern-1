                        We have bought and sold a home
                        with Nikki and each experience
                        was amazing! Nikki was always
                        communicating with us and made the
                        whole process stress free. Her network
                        in La Jolla seemed to have no limits
                        because she always found us what we
                        were looking for. We recommend Nikki
                        because she has the local knowledge,
                        expertise, communication, and
                        negotiation skills.

                        If youâ€™re looking for someone with the
                        local knowledge and expertise of San
                        Diego, then we highly recommend
                        Nikki. We were taken care of instantly
                        and are extremely grateful for all that
                        Nikki did for us. We were renting in
                        downtown and decided it was time to
                        move up the coast, we found Nikki
                        through our friend in Del Mar and
                        decided to work with her! Thanks to
                        Nikki, we found a great home for an
                        amazing price! When it comes down
                        to communication & negotiation skills,
                        Nikki is who you want to use!

                        Nikki is a true professional. We really
                        received white glove customer service
                        that made selling our home a breeze!
                        We have worked with other realtors
                        before but never received such great
                        care and communication. If we had
                        questions, Nikki answered them
                        and really made us feel taken care
                        of. Obviously, it was true because our
                        house sold in a matter of days! We
                        highly recommend using Nikki.

                        We have been working with Nikki for
                        over six years now. In each process, we
                        have always experienced great care
                        and professionalism. When we listed
                        our home recently, not only did we list
                        above the market price, but within 30
                        days we had a full price offer and closed
                        escrow! Working with escrow was great
                        and we strongly recommend using her.
