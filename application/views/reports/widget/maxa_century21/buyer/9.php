                For many people, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought new
                meaning to the word “home”. People have changed the way they
                work, learn, and interact with those around them. Although real
                estate is deemed an essential business, it incorporates a lot of
                “in-person” interaction that can cause concern for buyers.<br><br>
                I take the safety of my clients and our community very seriously. It
                is important to me to keep up and follow the COVID-19 industry
                guidelines as published by the California Department of Public
                Health. On top of staying educated on the subject and following
                all safety guidelines I also took it one step further by getting my
                COVID-19 Safety Certification. Giving you 121% always.

                        I want to be as effective as possible for
                        you. By getting specific on what your
                        wants/needs are we can minimize search
                        options and minimize any potential risk
                        of overviewing properties. This is the
                        perfect time to get picky about what you
                        want to see. No reason to risk your health
                        or the health of others around you for
                        something that doesn’t work.

                        Virtual tours have been a game changer
                        during the pandemic. They have
                        improved tremendously and can give
                        you a lot of information about the
                        property. Not only that, but a little
                        research online can give us
                        neighborhood info, property taxes,
                        statistics, and more. Driving by is also a
                        great way of viewing the neighborhood.
                        3-D tours have allowed many buyers to
                        even purchase a home site unseen!

                        In the event we must do an in-person
                        showing, it’s important to keep safety at
                        the forefront. It’s vital to only bring
                        decision makers to your appointment.
                        Wear face masks, wash and sanitize your
                        hands, and try not to touch anything you
                        don’t need to.

                        Because I want you to feel as safe and
                        comfortable as possible, I am in a
                        position to do almost everything digitally.
                        We can get contracts, disclosures, and
                        other items signed electronically. Using
                        tools like Zoom, Facetime, and Skype will
                        allow us to still connect and
                        communicate face to face.
