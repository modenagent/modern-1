            You are almost there! Closing is drawing near and soon
            you’ll be chanting “Home Sweet Home!”. To ensure a
            smooth closing, it’s imperative that you follow the
            previous guidelines we covered. As your agent, I will
            work with you and the necessary parties involved to
            make sure we tie up all loose ends.<br><br>
            We can’t predict the future, so of course, unexpected
            challenges may come up before you close. However, we
            will take the necessary steps to eliminate these obstacles
            sooner rather than later. It’s crucial that we have full
            transparency between us so that I can use my knowledge
            and experience to guide you to a stress-free closing.
