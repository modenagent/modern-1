                YOUR SALE:
            </h5>
            <b>1. Location</b>
            Location is the single greatest factor affecting value. A neighborhood’s
            desirability is basic to a property’s fair market value.
            <b>2. Competition</b>
            Buyers compare your property against others in that neighborhood, and
            interpret value based on properties available on the market.
            <b>3. Timing</b>
            The real estate market may refl ect a “buyers” or “sellers” market. Market
            conditions cannot be manipulated; an individually tailored marketing plan of
            action must be developed for each property.
            <b>4. Condition</b>
            The property condition will affect price and speed of sale. Optimizing physical
            appearance and advance preparation for marketing maximizes value.
            <b>5. Terms</b>
            The more terms available, the larger the market, the quicker the sale and the
            higher the price. Terms structured to meet your objectives are important to
            successful marketing.
            <b>6. Price</b>
            If the property is not properly priced, a sale may be delayed or even prevented.
            Reviewing the Comparative Market Analysis assists you in determining the best
            possible price.
