                Overpricing a home can result in damaging effects. It does not position your
                home among similar properties of the same value. Additionally, a newly
                listed property attracts the most interest, but if it’s priced too high, home
                buyers will steer clear. You’ll be forced to adjust the price far lower than
                desired, or worse: you’ll end up with no sale at all.
