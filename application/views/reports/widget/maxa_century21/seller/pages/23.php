        <b class="theme_color">OPEN MARKET SALES</b>
        Selling on the open market exposes the property to the greatest number of
        buyers, often resulting in the highest sale price and net proceeds to the seller.
        Every home is also eligible for sale on the open market. Open market sellers
        should expect some uncertainty about the amount of time necessary to complete
        the sale. In additon, the process of preparing the home for open houses and
        showings (in-person or virtual) should be taken into account. Properties listed for
        sale on the open market are still eligible to recieve cash offers.

        <b class="theme_color">BUY BEFORE YOU SELL</b>
        This solution empowers a homeowner to buy their next house before selling and
        moving out of their current home. This allows sellers to fi nd a new home, move
        when they are ready and sell without the hassle of dealing with showings. Most
        programs allow sellers to access a portion of the equity of their current home
        while still living in it. Buy before you sell service fees should be taken into account
        and not all properties and sellers are eligible.

        <b class="theme_color">INSTANT SALE</b>
        iBuyers usually purchase properties that are in good condition at close to the open
        market price with cash. Their service fees and prep and repair costs should be
        takeing into account. Closing costs are comparable to an open market sale. iBuyers
        enable selling without showings or open houses and can close on the seller’s
        timetable, often more quickly than selling on the openmarket.

        <b class="theme_color">INSTANT SALE - ANY CONDITION</b>
        Any condition iBuyers are a great resource for sellers who want the convenience
        and certainty of a cash offer, but whose property might need additional
        renovations. Any condition iBuyers purchase properties “as-is,” so all prep and
        repair expenses are factored into their offer amounts. These buyers specialize in
        renovations, so they can usually make repairs more cost effectively than the seller,
        and they pass along those savings to the seller. Therefore, although any condition
        iBuyer offer amounts may be lower than other options, the seller’s net proceeds
        may be higher. Any condition iBuyers can complete the entire process, from offer
        request to cloe, in just a few days.
