                <p class="small_text">
                    A home warranty is a service contract that covers the
                    repair or replacement of important home system
                    components and appliances that break down over
                    time. A home warranty can help save you money.

                <h4 class="table_title no_line">What Does It Cover</h4>
                <p class="small_text">
                    Items available for home warranty coverage may
                    include: central air conditioning systems, central
                    heating systems, kitchen appliances, clothes washer
                    and dryer, plumbing system, electrical system and
                    roof leaks. Many of these items are covered based
                    on the home warranty plan that you choose.

                <h4 class="table_title no_line">Home Warranty Vs. Home Insurance</h4>
                <p class="small_text">
                    Home Insurance covers what might happen, but
                    if your A/C, refrigerator, or heating system went
                    out, who would you call? Unlike most homeowners
                    insurance, a Home Warranty covers what will
                    happen like the inevitable breakdowns of major
                    home system components and appliances that wear
                    out over time.
