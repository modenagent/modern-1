    <h1 class="main_title top_title">PRICING CORRECTLY</h1>
    <p class="f14 mt-50">
        At any given time, there are plenty of buyers in the market looking for newly listed properties. As your
        agent, I want to make sure to help you attract as many buyers as possible. One thing that can hinder this
        is setting the price too high. The key to getting your home sold as quickly as possible is to price it correctly
        from day 1. Many sellers have the tendency to want to list their home at a higher sales price than advised because
        they hope to increase their profit or they assume that buyers always make low offers so it’s good
        to start high.

            <h4 class="medium_bold">1. On Market Longer</h4>
            <p class="f14">
                Properties that are over priced tend to stay on the
                market significantly longer than those that are
                priced to sell.
            </p>
            <h4 class="medium_bold">2. Price Reduction</h4>
            <p class="f14">
                Overpriced properties will most certainly need to
                do at least 1 price reduction to regenerate interest
                in your property.

            <p class="f14">
                Time lost in waiting for an off er can be time spent
                accepting off ers, conducting inspections & opening escrow.

            <h4 class="medium_bold">4. Stigma Developed</h4>
            <p class="f14">
                As buyers see the property advertised over and
                over again, they will start wondering if there’s
                something wrong with it.
